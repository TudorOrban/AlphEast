Contributing
============

At AlphEast, we believe in the value of the open-source, community-driven approach to developing a healthy software ecosystem. As such, contributions of any kind are highly encouraged and greatly appreciated. Whether you've found a bug, have a feature in mind, or see a need for documentation improvements, your input is valuable. We will soon add a roadmap covering the most pressing issues to work on, as well as our long-term goals.

Github Workflow
---------------
#. Fork and fetch the AlphEast repository.
#. Create a branch for your work with a suggestive name, e.g., ``feature-add-x``.
#. Make your changes in your branch, keeping commits small and focused. Aim for clear commit messages that explain the "why" behind your changes.
#. Submit a pull request (PR) to the repository once you're ready to share your contributions. Describe the changes you've made and any additional context that might help the review process.

Get Started Developing
----------------------
To work on AlphEast, you'll need to install a newer version of Python. After installation, open a terminal in the root of the repository and create a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv venv

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate

Then run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

This will package the library. You can then run any example project with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/full/main.py

Create your own example project to experiment with the library.

Style Guides
------------
We aim to maintain a clean and consistent codebase. Detailed style guides will be added soon. In the meantime, please adhere to the following general principles:

* Follow existing code conventions in the project.
* Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
* Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic.
